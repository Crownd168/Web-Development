        <h2>What is the Chevening Award?</h2>
        <h5>An indepth explanation</h5>
        <p>The Chevening Scholarship Awards is an initiative by the UK government,
            through its Foreign Commonwealth And Development Office, to foster
            partnership with other countries through training and development of
            leaders from these countries in a one year taught master degree
            programme at any UK university of their choice.
            These scholars are then expected to return to their countries and create
            change in their chosen field of endeavor.
            The Awards also aims to build and increase a global network of leaders
            across various developmental fields across the world.</p>
